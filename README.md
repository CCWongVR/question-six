### Instructions

Please create a HTML document using only HTML, CSS and JQUERY (and any jquery libraries you would like to include).
 
At the top of this document should be a <div> container that spans the width of the page, and is 250px in height. This <div> container should also have a 1 pixel wide red border.
 
Finally, beneath this <div> container, the document should display a form that does following:
 
 
 
a)	Displays the following fields: Name (Text Field), Phone Number (Text Field), Favorite color (Select Field with the following options: blue, green, red). The form also has a "submit" and "reset" button.
 
b)	Automatically formats the phone number (within the text field)  as it is entered by the user to include parentheses around the area code, and a hyphen after the 3-digit prefix.
 
Example:
 
(607)123-4567
 
c)When a user selects one of the colors from the select box, a javascript alert is generated that displays the name of the color.
 
d)When the submit button is clicked, the form information (name, phone number and favorite color) are populated in the <div> container at the top of the page.
